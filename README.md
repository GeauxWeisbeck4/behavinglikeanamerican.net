# Behaving Like An American

Behaving Like An American is a research and marketing firm company in Chicago. I am building the website for a client and they will be using it mainly as a landing hub and eventually will integrate a backend for their company to work remotely with. .

## To Get Started

If you want to utilize this template, the original can be found here. To start with this specific repository, you can clone it directly to your local dev environment with the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/geauxweisbeck4/behavinglikeanamerican.net
cd behavinglikeanamerican.net
npm install
npm start
```

You can edit!

## This Project is Open Source

The main project got the ok from the client to be created open source, so feel free to contribute! There's some private backend stuff we can't share on here, but the front end is sort of experimental anyways right now. Have a go at it and submit a pull request or an issue!
