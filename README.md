# Behaving Like An American

Behaving Like An American is a research and marketing firm, created by me (Andrew Weisbeck) to complement his agency Tar Heel Dev Studio as well as my other businesses. The name comes from an old blog I used to write about Behavioral Economics. It now serves as my reserach and marketing firm that utilizes behavioral science, economics, and marketing research to develop solutions for end users of my software.
