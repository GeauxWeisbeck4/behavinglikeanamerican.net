### Task

Created a company website for the Defi Ours Team using Astro, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It was a fairly bare bones design for the site to just have something functional for the hackathon so the team could have a main hub. Developed back end as well which featured logins and presentation platform.

### Solution

Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.
